NEXT STEPS: GitHub Actions for Automatic Mac + Windows Builds
=================================================================

CURRENT SITUATION:
------------------
- We built eastWing.exe on Windows using PyInstaller
- Your Mac friend needs a Mac executable but doesn't want to install Python/venv
- You don't have a Mac to build on

THE SOLUTION: GitHub Actions (Free!)
-------------------------------------
GitHub can automatically build BOTH Windows and Mac executables in the cloud
whenever you create a release. No Mac needed!

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. We create a workflow file (.github/workflows/build.yml)
2. When you create a GitHub release (tag like "v1.0"), GitHub automatically:
   - Spins up a Windows VM and builds eastWing.exe
   - Spins up a Mac VM and builds eastWing (Mac executable)
   - Attaches BOTH files to your release
3. Users download the version they need (Windows or Mac)

WHAT I NEED TO DO (TOMORROW):
------------------------------
1. Create .github/workflows/build.yml file
   - Contains instructions for GitHub to build on Windows and Mac
   - Will include your .env file in both builds
   - Uses PyInstaller on both platforms

2. Commit and push the workflow file to GitHub

3. Create a test release (v1.0) to trigger the workflow

4. Wait ~5-10 minutes for GitHub to build both executables

5. Download and test both versions

BENEFITS:
---------
- FREE (GitHub Actions is free for public repos)
- Automatic - just create a release tag, builds happen automatically
- Both Windows and Mac executables in one release
- You never need to manually run PyInstaller again
- Professional distribution setup

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
----------------
When you create a release on GitHub, you'll see:
- eastWing.exe (Windows)
- eastWing-macos (Mac)
Both attached as downloadable assets

YOUR FRIEND JUST:
-----------------
1. Goes to GitHub releases
2. Downloads eastWing-macos
3. Double-clicks to run
4. Done!

CURRENT FILES READY:
--------------------
✅ eastWing.exe (in root folder) - 17 MB Windows executable
✅ DISTRIBUTION_README.md - User instructions
✅ .env file with your API keys (will be bundled in both builds)
✅ eastWing.py - Source code
✅ requirements.txt - Dependencies

TOMORROW'S SESSION PLAN:
------------------------
1. Show you this file
2. Create the GitHub Actions workflow
3. Commit & push
4. Create a v1.0 release
5. Watch GitHub build both executables automatically
6. Test downloads
7. Done!

TIME ESTIMATE: 15-20 minutes total

ALTERNATIVE (If you don't want GitHub Actions):
------------------------------------------------
- Release Windows .exe now (v1.0)
- Find a friend with a Mac to run PyInstaller once
- Release Mac build separately (v1.1)

But GitHub Actions is MUCH easier and automatic for future updates!

=================================================================
END OF NEXT STEPS
=================================================================

REMINDER: What we accomplished today:
- Installed PyInstaller in venv
- Built eastWing.exe with bundled .env file
- Created DISTRIBUTION_README.md
- Identified need for Mac build
- Planned GitHub Actions solution

See you tomorrow!
