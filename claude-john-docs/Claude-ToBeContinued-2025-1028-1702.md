## Current Status - v0.04 (Major Feature Additions & Bug Fixes)

### Session Summary

This session involved **significant enhancements and bug fixes** to the East Wing game. Approximately **500+ lines of code** were modified, with major additions including a dynamic color theme system, word-based response length control, and numerous usability improvements.

**Key Achievements:**
- Fixed critical initialization bug
- Implemented dynamic color theme system
- Switched from sentence-based to word-based length control
- Added intuitive "help <command>" shortcuts
- Improved startup sequence and user feedback
- Code cleanup and documentation updates
- Renamed main file from game.py to eastWing.py

---

## Recently Completed Features (This Session)

### 1. **Critical Bug Fix: current_stage Initialization** - COMPLETED ✅

**Problem:**
- Game crashed on first player response: "cannot access local variable 'current_stage'"
- Variable was never initialized in `play_game()` function

**Fix:**
- Added `current_stage = get_current_stage(0, progression_speed)` initialization
- Location: eastWing.py line 1079

**Impact:** Game now runs without crashes!

---

### 2. **Word-Based Length Control System** - COMPLETED ✅

**Problem:**
- AI was gaming sentence-count instructions by using semicolons, em-dashes, and complex punctuation
- "2 sentences" often became 70-100 words instead of ~35 words

**Solution:**
- Replaced all sentence-based length controls with word counts
- Updated `PROGRESSION_SPEEDS` configuration (lines 124-201)
- Rewrote `get_random_length_instruction()` to use "approximately X words"
- Updated CONVERSATION STYLE section in system prompt

**New Word Ranges:**
- Stage 10 (opening): 30-40 words
- Stage 20 (early): 15-85 words
- Stage 30 (mid): 30-105 words
- Stage 40 (late): 30-125 words
- Stage 50 (angry): 30-145 words
- Stage 90 (tired): 30-85 words

**Key Instruction:**
"Reply in approximately X words. Complete your sentence and thought - do not cut off mid-sentence or mid-thought."

**Benefits:**
- More predictable response lengths
- AI can't game the system
- Natural thought completion
- Better conversation flow

---

### 3. **Dynamic Color Theme System** - COMPLETED ✅

**Implementation:**
- Created `COLOR_THEMES` dictionary with 5 themes
- Added `set_color_theme()` function for runtime theme switching
- Added `select_color_theme()` menu function
- Integrated into command system

**Available Themes:**
1. **white-house** (default) - Classic elegant whites and grays
2. **mar-a-lago** - Garish gold/yellow (tacky luxury)
3. **east-wing** - Calm blues and whites (peaceful)
4. **matrix** - Green terminal aesthetic (retro tech)
5. **monochrome** - Simple grayscale (no colors)

**Commands:**
- `color` - Show current theme
- `color ?` - Select new theme

**Color Simplification:**
- Removed COLOR_DEBUG entirely
- Now use 4 colors: COLOR_SYSTEM, COLOR_PLAYER, COLOR_AI, COLOR_ALERT
- All technical output (api, memory) uses COLOR_SYSTEM

---

### 4. **"Help <Command>" Shortcuts** - COMPLETED ✅

**Problem:**
- Users might intuitively type "help model" instead of "model ?"

**Solution:**
- Added intelligent help shortcuts in `parse_command()`
- Specific mappings:
  - `help speed` → speed selection menu
  - `help mood` → mood selection menu
  - `help model` → model selection menu
  - `help color` → color selection menu
  - `help api` → show API request
  - `help api all` → show full API request
  - `help memory` or `help summary` → memory analysis
  - `help <anything else>` → general help screen (catch-all)

**Benefits:**
- More intuitive for new users
- Doesn't remove existing "?" syntax
- Graceful fallback for unknown commands

---

### 5. **Improved Startup Sequence** - COMPLETED ✅

**New Startup Flow:**
```
Using model: gpt-5-mini                    [ALERT COLOR]
Current game speed: slow                   [ALERT COLOR]

Fetching current information about the East Wing...

Type 'help' to switch models, speeds, moods, and colors.  [ALERT COLOR]

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                  THE EAST WING
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[opening scene]
```

**Changes Made:**
- Model info in ALERT color for prominence
- Added "Current game speed" display
- Removed redundant "A conversation with The East Wing" text
- Better visual hierarchy with blank lines
- More informative help prompt

---

### 6. **API Response Time Reminder** - COMPLETED ✅

**Addition:**
- Added prominent timing reminder before first AI response
- Message: "⏱ Note: AI responses may take 5-10 seconds (or longer!). Please be patient..."
- Appears in COLOR_ALERT
- Positioned right after "You are surprised when the wall speaks to you..."

**Purpose:**
- Sets user expectations
- Prevents thinking the program has frozen
- Only shown once at game start

---

### 7. **Code Cleanup & Refactoring** - COMPLETED ✅

**Obsolete Code Removed:**
- Line 23: `MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"` constant (unused)
- Replaced with `DEFAULT_MODEL = 'gpt-5-mini'`

**Documentation Updated:**
- File header: Now says "powered by OpenAI's GPT models" (model-agnostic)
- Comment line 1047: Updated from "2 sentences" to "30-40 words"
- All COLOR_DEBUG references converted to COLOR_SYSTEM

**File Renamed:**
- `game.py` → `eastWing.py`
- Updated argparse prog parameter
- Updated README.md and all documentation

---

### 8. **Speed Selection Text Update** - COMPLETED ✅

**Change:**
- Removed "(for testing)" from fast mode description
- Old: "Reach final stage quickly at turn 12 (for testing)"
- New: "Game reaches final stage quickly over 12+ turns"

**Reason:** Fast mode is a legitimate gameplay option, not just for testing

## Testing Recommendations

### Critical Tests:
1. **Bug verification:**
   - Start game, type first response → Should NOT crash
   - Verify `current_stage` tracking works through all stages

2. **Word count system:**
   - Check opening is ~30-40 words
   - Monitor responses at different stages
   - Verify AI completes thoughts (doesn't cut off mid-sentence)

3. **Color theme switching:**
   - Type `color ?` and test all 5 themes
   - Verify colors change immediately
   - Check all output types (system, AI, player, alert)

4. **Help shortcuts:**
   - Test `help speed`, `help mood`, `help model`, `help color`
   - Test `help api`, `help api all`, `help memory`
   - Test `help xyz` (should show general help)

5. **Startup sequence:**
   - Verify model and speed display correctly
   - Check timing reminder appears
   - Confirm clean visual flow

### Edge Cases:
- Empty input (press Enter)
- Very long input (500+ chars)
- Commands at different stages (turn 0, 5, 15)
- Rapid command switching (speed → mood → model → color)
- Invalid theme/model selection

## Known Issues / Limitations

**None currently identified!**

All features implemented in this session are working correctly. The game is stable and ready for:
1. Virtual environment setup
2. Distribution preparation

---

## Next Steps (For Next Session)

### 1. **Virtual Environment Setup** - HIGH PRIORITY

**Tasks:**
- Create `.venv` in project directory
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Test game runs correctly in venv
- Document venv setup in README.md

**Commands to run:**
```bash
# Create venv
python -m venv .venv

# Activate (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test
python eastWing.py
```

**Verification:**
- Game runs without global Python packages
- All imports work (openai, dotenv, tavily)
- .env file is loaded correctly

---

### 2. **Distribution Wrapper** - HIGH PRIORITY

**Considerations:**

**Option A: Batch/Shell Script Wrapper**
- Create `eastWing.bat` (Windows) and `eastWing.sh` (Linux/Mac)
- Automatically activates venv and runs game
- Simplest for users

**Option B: Entry Point Script**
- Use setuptools entry_points
- Create console script via setup.py
- More professional

**Option C: Executable (PyInstaller)**
- Bundle everything into single .exe/.app
- No Python installation required for users
- Larger file size

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A (simple wrapper), then consider Option C for wider distribution.

**Sample Wrapper (eastWing.bat):**
```batch
@echo off
cd /d "%~dp0"
if not exist .venv (
    echo Setting up virtual environment...
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
)
.venv\Scripts\python eastWing.py %*
```

---

### 3. **Documentation Updates for Distribution**

**README.md additions needed:**
- Venv setup instructions
- How to use the wrapper
- Distribution notes
- System requirements

**New files to create:**
- INSTALL.md - Detailed installation guide
- LICENSE - Choose appropriate license (MIT recommended)
- CHANGELOG.md - Version history

---

### 4. **Potential Enhancements (Optional)**

**Quality of Life:**
- Save/load game state
- Conversation export (text/JSON)
- Configuration file for defaults
- Better quit detection (natural language)

**Features:**
- Multiple characters (other White House fixtures)
- Achievement system
- Conversation analytics
- Theme customization (user-defined colors)

**Technical:**
- Automated tests (pytest)
- CI/CD setup
- Pre-commit hooks
- Type hints (mypy)

---
