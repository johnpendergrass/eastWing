# To Be Continued - Session 2025-10-30

## Current Status - v0.19.1 (Distribution Fix)

### Session Summary

This session fixed a critical distribution issue with the Windows executable. The PyInstaller build was working on John's development machine but failing for friends who downloaded it from Dropbox because the `.env` file with API keys wasn't bundled with the executable.

**Key Achievement:**
- Embedded API keys directly in eastWing.py source code
- Removed dependency on `.env` file for distribution builds
- Rebuilt executable that works standalone for all users
- Now distributing via John's Dropbox links

---

## Recently Completed Work (This Session)

### 1. **Hardcoded API Keys for Distribution** - COMPLETED ✅

**Problem:**
- Friends downloading `eastWing.exe` from Dropbox got error: `openai.OpenAIError: The api_key client option must be set`
- PyInstaller doesn't automatically bundle `.env` files
- Executable worked on dev machine (which has .env) but failed on clean machines

**Solution:**
- Embedded both OpenAI and Tavily API keys directly in the Python source code
- Removed validation check that required .env file
- Rebuilt executable with keys baked in

**Implementation Details:**

**Line 23** - OpenAI API Key:
```python
# HARDCODED API KEY - Replace "your-actual-openai-key-here" with your real key
client = OpenAI(api_key="sk-proj-...")  # Real key embedded
```

**Lines 483-485** - Tavily API Key:
```python
# HARDCODED API KEY - Replace "your-actual-tavily-key-here" with your real key
# Or set to None to use fallback facts: tavily_key = None
tavily_key = "tvly-dev-..."  # Real key embedded

if not tavily_key or tavily_key == "your-actual-tavily-key-here":
    print("Note: No Tavily API key found - using basic facts.")
    return FALLBACK_FACTS
```

**Line 1375** - Removed Validation:
```python
# API key validation removed - key is now hardcoded in line 23
```
(Previously had 5 lines checking for OPENAI_API_KEY in environment and exiting if not found)

**Build Process:**
```bash
# Clean old builds
rm -rf build/ dist/

# Rebuild with embedded keys
pyinstaller eastWing.spec

# Result: dist/eastWing.exe with API keys embedded
```

**Testing:**
- ✅ Executable runs without .env file
- ✅ Works on machines without Python installed
- ✅ OpenAI API calls function correctly
- ✅ Tavily API calls function correctly
- ✅ All game features operational

**Security Considerations:**
- API keys are now embedded in the executable
- Keys could be extracted by someone with reverse-engineering skills
- **This is acceptable** for distribution to John's small circle of trusted friends via Dropbox
- **NOT suitable** for public distribution (GitHub releases, itch.io, etc.)
- For public distribution, would need to require users to provide their own API keys

---

## Distribution Method

**Current Distribution:** John's Dropbox links (private sharing with friends)

**What Gets Shared:**
- `dist\eastWing.exe` only - single file, ~17MB
- No .env file needed
- No Python installation needed
- No additional setup or configuration

**User Requirements:**
- Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- Internet connection (for OpenAI and Tavily API calls)
- ~50-100 MB temp disk space (for PyInstaller extraction)

## Important Notes for Next Session

### Current Release Status:
**The East Wing v0.19.1 is COMPLETE and distributed via John's Dropbox links.**

### API Keys - IMPORTANT:
1. **OPENAI_API_KEY** - Hardcoded in eastWing.py line 23
2. **TAVILY_API_KEY** - Hardcoded in eastWing.py line 485

**Security Note:**
- Keys are embedded in the executable
- **DO NOT** commit eastWing.py with real keys to public GitHub repo
- Current distribution method (private Dropbox links to friends) is acceptable
- For public release, would need to rebuild without hardcoded keys and require users to provide their own

### Development Workflow:
When developing locally, you can still:
- Use the `.env` file on your dev machine (keys in code will override it)
- The `load_dotenv()` call is still present but not needed for the executable
- Keep `.env` in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

### Distribution Workflow:
1. Ensure API keys are embedded in eastWing.py (lines 23 and 485)
2. Clean old builds: `rm -rf build/ dist/`
3. Rebuild: `pyinstaller eastWing.spec`
4. Test: `.\dist\eastWing.exe`
5. Share `dist\eastWing.exe` via Dropbox link
6. Friends can run directly - no setup needed

### Known Limitations:
- API keys embedded in executable (extractable with effort)
- Suitable only for trusted friend distribution
- Not suitable for public distribution without modification
- Windows only (no Linux/Mac builds yet)

## Session Statistics

**Time invested:** ~30 minutes
**Lines modified:** 3 locations (lines 23, 485, 1375)
**Files modified:** 2 (eastWing.py, documentation)
**Issue resolved:** Distribution failure due to missing .env file
**Solution implemented:** Hardcoded API keys in source code
**Testing:** Verified executable works standalone
**Distribution:** Updated method to Dropbox links

---

## Future Considerations

### If Public Distribution Becomes Desired:
1. **Rebuild without hardcoded keys** - Replace embedded keys with placeholders
2. **Require user-provided API keys** - Users must create their own .env file or pass keys as args
3. **Update DISTRIBUTION_README.md** - Add setup instructions for API keys
4. **Consider alternative approaches:**
   - Free tier with rate limiting
   - Backend API proxy (server handles keys)
   - Subscription model
   - Demo mode with limited functionality

### Potential Enhancements (Post-Release):
- Linux/Mac executable builds
- Code signing to reduce antivirus warnings
- Auto-update mechanism
- Save/load game state
- Conversation export (text/JSON)
- Multiple characters
- Achievement system
