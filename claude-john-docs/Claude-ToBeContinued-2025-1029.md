# To Be Continued - Session 2025-10-29

## Current Status - v0.19.1 (Initial Public Release)

### Session Summary

This session completed the East Wing game and prepared it for initial public release as **v0.19.1**. The session included adding user experience improvements, building a Windows executable, and successfully testing on multiple machines.

**Key Achievements:**
- Added `turn` command to show current turn number, speed, mood, and model
- Added `?` as a synonym for the `help` command
- Successfully built Windows executable (eastWing.exe) using PyInstaller
- Tested executable on multiple machines without Python installed
- Confirmed standalone distribution works correctly

---

## Recently Completed Features (This Session)

### 1. **Turn Command** - COMPLETED ✅

**Feature:**
- Added new `turn` command that displays quick status summary
- Shows: Turn number, Speed (slow/fast), Mood (mild/upset/serious/angry/tired), Model (current AI model)
- No selection menu (no `turn ?`) since it's just a display command

**Implementation:**
- Added command parsing in `parse_command()` at line 862
- Added command handler in `play_game()` main loop at line 1238
- Updated help screen in `display_help()` at line 1016
- Updated documentation in specifications.md

**Example Output:**
```
Turn: 5, Speed: slow, Mood: upset, Model: gpt-5-mini
```

**Why This Is Useful:**
- Quick reference without opening full help screen
- Helps players track their progression
- Shows which AI model is currently in use
- Especially useful when mood is manually overridden
- Consistent with other status commands (speed, mood, model, color)

**Code Changes:**
- **eastWing.py** line 862: Parse turn command
- **eastWing.py** line 1238-1240: Handle turn_show command with model display
- **eastWing.py** line 1016: Add to help screen
- **specifications.md** line 483: Document in Runtime Commands section

### 2. **'?' as Help Synonym** - COMPLETED ✅

**Feature:**
- Added `?` as a quick alternative to typing `help`
- Single character shortcut for accessing help screen

**Implementation:**
- Modified command parsing in `parse_command()` at line 804
- Changed from `if text == 'help':` to `if text in ['help', '?']:`
- Updated help screen at line 991 to show both options
- Updated documentation in specifications.md

**Why This Is Useful:**
- Intuitive shortcut (? is universally associated with help)
- Faster to type than "help"
- Common convention in many command-line tools
- Reduces friction for users seeking assistance

**Code Changes:**
- **eastWing.py** line 804: Parse '?' as help command
- **eastWing.py** line 991: Update help screen to show "help, ?"
- **specifications.md** lines 460, 509: Document '?' synonym

---

### 3. **Windows Executable Distribution** - COMPLETED ✅

**Feature:**
- Created standalone Windows executable using PyInstaller
- Tested successfully on multiple machines without Python installed
- Single-file distribution (~17 MB)

**Build Configuration:**
- **File:** eastWing.spec
- **Mode:** --onefile (single executable)
- **Compression:** UPX enabled for smaller file size
- **Console:** True (terminal-based application)
- **Platform:** Windows 10+ (64-bit)

**What's Bundled:**
- Complete Python 3.x runtime
- All dependencies (openai, python-dotenv, tavily-python)
- Standard library modules
- .env file (contains API keys - bundled for convenience)

**Build Process:**
```bash
# Clean old builds
rm -rf build/ dist/

# Rebuild executable
pyinstaller eastWing.spec

# Result
dist/eastWing.exe (~17 MB)
```

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Runs on Windows 10 without Python installed
- ✅ Runs on Windows 11 without Python installed
- ✅ All commands work correctly (help, turn, speed, mood, model, color, api, memory)
- ✅ AI responses function properly
- ✅ Color themes display correctly
- ✅ All features verified functional

**Distribution Files:**
- `dist/eastWing.exe` - Main executable
- `DISTRIBUTION_README.md` - User instructions and notes
- `.env` - Bundled with API keys (for user convenience)

**User Requirements:**
- Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- Internet connection (for OpenAI API calls)
- .env file with API keys (bundled in this build)
- ~50-100 MB temp disk space (for PyInstaller extraction at runtime)

**Known Limitations:**
- Antivirus may flag as suspicious (common with PyInstaller - false positive)
- Slower startup (1-3 seconds for extraction on first run)
- Temp files accumulate in %TEMP% directory
- API keys bundled in executable (future versions should require user-provided .env)
