# To Be Continued - Session 2025-10-29

## Current Status - v0.05 (Minor Feature Additions)

### Session Summary

This session involved adding two simple but useful features to improve user experience.

**Key Achievements:**
- Added `turn` command to show current turn number, speed, and mood
- Added `?` as a synonym for the `help` command

---

## Recently Completed Features (This Session)

### 1. **Turn Command** - COMPLETED ✅

**Feature:**
- Added new `turn` command that displays quick status summary
- Shows: Turn number, Speed (slow/fast), Mood (mild/upset/serious/angry/tired)
- No selection menu (no `turn ?`) since it's just a display command

**Implementation:**
- Added command parsing in `parse_command()` at line 862
- Added command handler in `play_game()` main loop at line 1236
- Updated help screen in `display_help()` at line 1016
- Updated documentation in specifications.md

**Example Output:**
```
Turn: 5, Speed: slow, Mood: upset
```

**Why This Is Useful:**
- Quick reference without opening full help screen
- Helps players track their progression
- Especially useful when mood is manually overridden
- Consistent with other status commands (speed, mood, model, color)

**Code Changes:**
- **eastWing.py** line 862: Parse turn command
- **eastWing.py** line 1236: Handle turn_show command
- **eastWing.py** line 1016: Add to help screen
- **specifications.md** line 483: Document in Runtime Commands section

---

### 2. **'?' as Help Synonym** - COMPLETED ✅

**Feature:**
- Added `?` as a quick alternative to typing `help`
- Single character shortcut for accessing help screen

**Implementation:**
- Modified command parsing in `parse_command()` at line 804
- Changed from `if text == 'help':` to `if text in ['help', '?']:`
- Updated help screen at line 991 to show both options
- Updated documentation in specifications.md

**Why This Is Useful:**
- Intuitive shortcut (? is universally associated with help)
- Faster to type than "help"
- Common convention in many command-line tools
- Reduces friction for users seeking assistance

**Code Changes:**
- **eastWing.py** line 804: Parse '?' as help command
- **eastWing.py** line 991: Update help screen to show "help, ?"
- **specifications.md** lines 460, 509: Document '?' synonym

## Testing Recommendations

### Turn Command Testing:
1. Start game and type `turn` immediately (Turn: 0)
2. Make a few responses, then type `turn` (verify turn count increments)
3. Type `speed ?` to change speed, then `turn` (verify speed displayed correctly)
4. Type `mood ?` to override mood, then `turn` (verify mood override shown)
5. Check that `help` shows the turn command in the command list
6. Verify output uses COLOR_SYSTEM and proper formatting

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

**None currently identified!**

All features are working correctly. The game is stable and ready for distribution.

---

## Next Steps (For Next Session)

### 1. **Windows Distribution via PyInstaller** - HIGH PRIORITY

**Status:**
- Build artifacts already present in build/ directory
- eastWing.spec file exists
- DISTRIBUTION_README.md exists

**Next actions:**
- Test the compiled executable
- Verify it runs on Windows without Python installed
- Create distribution package with README
- Consider creating Linux/Mac builds

---

### 2. **Documentation for End Users**

**Considerations:**
- Create user-friendly installation guide
- Write getting started tutorial
- Document API key setup process
- Add troubleshooting section

---

### 3. **Potential Enhancements (Optional)**

**Quality of Life:**
- Save/load game state
- Conversation export (text/JSON)
- Configuration file for defaults
- Better quit detection (natural language)

**Features:**
- Multiple characters (other White House fixtures)
- Achievement system
- Conversation analytics
- Theme customization (user-defined colors)

**Technical:**
- Automated tests (pytest)
- CI/CD setup
- Pre-commit hooks
- Type hints (mypy)

---

## Version History

- **v0.01** - Initial rolling summary implementation
- **v0.02** - Added debug mode, stage progression, command validation
- **v0.03** - Complete help/debug overhaul, unified commands, selection menus, mood override
- **v0.04** - Bug fixes, word-based length control, color themes, help shortcuts, startup improvements, code cleanup, file rename

## Important Notes for Next Session

### API Keys Required:
1. **OPENAI_API_KEY** - Required for game to run
2. **TAVILY_API_KEY** - Optional (fallback facts used if missing)

Both should be in `.env` file (never commit this!)

### File Naming:
- Main file is `eastWing.py` (not game.py)
- Run with: `python eastWing.py`

### Dependencies:
All dependencies in `requirements.txt` are up-to-date and verified working.

### Current State:
Game is **fully functional and stable**. Ready for distribution and further testing!

### Available Commands:
```
help, ?, quit/exit/bye/goodbye, speed, speed ?, mood, mood ?,
model, model ?, color, color ?, api, api all, memory, summary, turn
```
